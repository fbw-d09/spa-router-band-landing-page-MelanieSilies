[![Status overview badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/main/badge.svg)](#-results)


## A small exercise to react-router

### Tasks:
-   Complete this small React app for your favorite music band.
-   Implement a navigation menu for your app with at least four items: "vocals," "bass," "guitar," and "drums."
-   Use [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/) package to handle navigation within your app.
-   It's not required to implement transitions between pages.
-   Choose images of your favorite music band for each navigation item. The image file names should include the name of the corresponding navigation item (e.g., "guitar-example.png", "vocals.png", etc.).
-   When a user clicks on a navigation item, the app should navigate to a path that includes the name of the item (e.g., "/vocals", "/bass", "/guitar", "/drums").
-   Create a <main> container element that will hold a single image. When a user clicks on a navigation item, the displayed image should change to the one corresponding to the clicked item, as shown in the following preview.
